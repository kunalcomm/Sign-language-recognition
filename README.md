# Sign Language Recognition using MediaPipe & OpenCV 🤟

##  Overview
This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.  
It detects hand landmarks through a webcam and recognizes different hand gestures based on finger positions and thumb orientation. The recognized gestures are displayed as text on the screen.

This project is created for learning and experimentation with computer vision and gesture-based interaction.
